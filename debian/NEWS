dar (2.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  dar_static is no longer built by this package. This is a work around due to a
  bug in an unrelated package, see http://bugs.debian.org/632889

  If upgrading from dar 2.3.x, you may need to alter backup scripts to add the
  "--alter=secu" parameter. See http://bugs.debian.org/637991 and
  http://dar.linux.free.fr/doc/FAQ.html#security for details.
